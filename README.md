Hello, I'm eboatwright.<br>
I do alot of different things, I've spent alot of time making games, but lately I've been making websites and phone apps in Flutter.<br>
I've used lots of languages for certain projects, from C# to Rust, and Ruby to Java, and I've tried languages like Zig, Haskell, and D.<br>

Newest game!
