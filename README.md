Hello, I'm eboatwright.<br>
For my personal projects, I've worked on games, websites, and mobile apps in Flutter.<br>
I've used lots of languages: from C# to Rust, and Ruby to Java, but I've tried languages like Zig, Haskell, and D.<br>

Currently looking for a job (preferably part-time) in Flutter.<br>

Newest game!
